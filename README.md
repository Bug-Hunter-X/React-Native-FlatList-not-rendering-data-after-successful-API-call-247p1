# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data from an API call even when the fetch operation is successful.  The problem stems from how asynchronous operations and state updates interact within the component's lifecycle.

## Bug Description

The `DataFetch` component fetches data from a public API. Although the API call succeeds and the data is correctly received, the FlatList remains empty.  This is often due to incorrect state updates or timing issues related to the asynchronous nature of `fetch`.

## Solution

The solution provided addresses this by ensuring the data is correctly updated and reflected in the UI using appropriate state management and lifecycle methods.  The `useEffect` hook is used to perform the data fetch, and the `isLoading` and `error` states handle loading and error states effectively.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app.
